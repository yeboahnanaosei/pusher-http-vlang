V module for interacting with the Pusher Channels HTTP API   
Pusher is a service that lets you build realtime features into your application.  
Read about pusher here: [Pusher.com](https://pusher.com)

### ⚠️ WARNING:  
This is a very early stage implementation. It is more of a proof-of-concept.  
**However, the goal is to build a full featured client for V.**  
At the moment several things 
* Code duplication everywhere
* No error handling
* Possibly inefficient code
* etc...

### GOALS:
* Completely satisfy the specification: [Pusher Server Library Specification](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/library_auth_reference/server-library-reference-specification/)
* Strive to become an "officially-supported" library.  
  
    > The library MUST offer the following features to be considered feature-complete and be  open for consideration as an “officially-supported” Channels server library by Pusher.
